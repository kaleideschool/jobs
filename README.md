### Nature-based Active Learning

**Kaleide International School is a small co-educational day school for children aged from 3 to 12 years, based on the principles of experiential active learning and democratic education.** Our name, Kaleide, takes inspiration from the Ancient Greek words καλός (kalos), for ‟beautiful”, and εἶδος (eidos), “form, shape”, which appropriately reflect the school's aim to create a beautiful and dynamic learning environment integrating diversity, creativity and the joy of learning.

At Kaleide, children are able to decide how to spend their time, and their opinion is valued and acted on in all matters which affect them; they learn through free play, autonomy, creativity and connection to nature, within a community which is based on caring relationships and empathy. **Kaleide isn’t just an alternative school: it is a project which seeks to inspire deep changes in education, and in society at large.**

**Our school opened in La Laguna (Tenerife) in September 2021, with an initial capacity for 60 students (29 preschool and 35 primary students).** We have been admitted to the prestigious NEASC (New England Schools and Colleges Association) certification process.

Kaleide International School is the result of an extensive and ongoing seven-year research involving the theory of pedagogy, developmental psychology, and learning; study visits to over thirty innovative schools in the Netherlands, Germany, the UK, Spain, and the United States; and over one hundred video recorded interviews with teachers, experts, parents and students in those countries.

Our commitment is to incorporate this experience –as well as our passion for education– to a school that will not only allow children the time and space they need to develop, but will also encourage different ways of thinking about education and childhood, in the same way that a kaleidoscope composes new and changing images of reality out of multiple reflections.
