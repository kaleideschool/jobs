# Key Stage 1 and Key Stage 2 Facilitator

#### **JOB DESCRIPTION**

We are primarily looking for someone who trusts children and their innate ability to learn, who respects their autonomy, and who loves to spend time in the open air. Our teachers \(or “facilitators”, as we prefer to call them\) act as models and mentors for the children. Above all, they need to be grounded in partnership-based relationships and personal responsibility.

As a facilitator, in partnership with the rest of the school’s staff team, students, and parents, you will be:

* ensuring children’s physical and emotional needs are met
* facilitating the children’s interests and play
* fostering curiosity and treating every experience as an adventure
* supporting students as they engage with the cycle of learning \(planning, making, reflecting, and sharing\)
* recognising and acting on daily opportunities to turn a learner’s curiosity into a deeper investigation
* leading weekly offerings in at least one of the main categories \(Music, Movement, Science, or Art\)
* organising the school's weekly outings to a nearby forest
* overseeing conflict resolution and fostering cohesion
* inspiring without directing the children
* developing a positive communication and a caring relationship with parents
* attending staff meetings and training sessions

Since we encourage age-mixed groups, there will be many opportunities to work with younger children. 

This is a full time position \(Monday - Friday\).

#### **ESSENTIAL QUALITIES:** 

* Creativity, playfulness, curiosity and a love for learning
* Self-direction, resourcefulness and self-motivation
* Experience cultivating authentic, respectful, and partnership-based relationships with people of all ages
* Love of working with young children
* A passion for self-directed and democratic education
* An understanding of how, through play, children can develop their curiosity, autonomy and understanding of the world around them
* Ability to empower children to solve problems themselves
* Skill in developing student-led democratic meetings and discussions
* Enjoyment of being outdoors and a passion for helping children learn about the natural environment
* Willingness to work towards an unconditional approach \(no punishment or reward, including praise\)
* Ability to adapt to changing circumstances and to navigate interpersonal relationships
* A variety of interests and abilities that you will enjoy sharing with young people

#### **ESSENTIAL QUALIFICATIONS:**

* Native English speaker 
* UK qualified with Bachelor of Education/PGCE or QTS 
* Familiarity with the British National Curriculum
* Paediatric first aid \(ideally with outdoor specialism - this can be arranged if not held\)

#### **DESIRABLE QUALITIES AND QUALIFICATIONS**

* Spanish
* Experience and training in alternative education \(Democratic Education, Reggio Emilia, Montessori, Forest Schools, etc.\)
* Training in non-violent communication and active listening
* Love of outdoor sports
* Experience in DIY or DIWO activities

#### **WHAT WE CAN OFFER:**

* The opportunity to enjoy working in a highly motivated team, with children who are eager to learn, and in a family-like school community where parents are very supportive. The newly renovated sustainable school building is surrounded by gardens, and located close to the city centre of the beautiful San Cristóbal de La Laguna, Tenerife.
* Salary according to the Spanish Teachers Collective Bargaining Agreement in force, and a benefits package.
* In-house training for continuous professional development.
* Lunch time meals eaten at the school with the children.
