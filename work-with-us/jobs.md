# Work with us

{% hint style="success" %}
We are currently recruiting teachers whose native language is English to join us in the 2021-22 school year.
{% endhint %}

We are primarily looking for someone who understands our vision and who shares the school's values, and who is as comfortable outdoors as indoors. Relevant qualifications –as well as a commitment to professional development– are essential. Spanish is not a requirement but would be an advantage.  
Your duties will include:

* Ensuring children’s physical and emotional needs are met
* Facilitating the children’s interests, projects, workshops and play
* Organising the school's weekly outings to a nearby forest
* Overseeing conflict resolution and fostering cohesion
* Inspiring without directing the children
* Developing a positive communication and a caring relationship with parents
* Attending staff meetings and training sessions

  
Since we encourage age-mixed groups, there will be opportunities to work with children of all ages \(3-11\).   
This is a full time position of 35 hours per week, including staff meetings, open evenings, and lunch time \(when lunch is eaten with the children at the school.\)  
  
**Essential qualities:** 

* Creativity, playfulness and a love for learning
* Love of working with children
* A passion for self-directed and democratic education
* An understanding of how, through play, children can develop their curiosity, autonomy and understanding of the world around them
* Ability to empower children to solve problems themselves
* Enjoyment of being outdoors and a passion for helping children learn about the natural environment
* Willingness to work towards an unconditional approach \(no punishment or reward, including praise\)
* Experience of making and recording observations
* An understanding of the key requirements of the Primary curriculum

  
**Essential qualifications:**

* Native English speaker 
* Bachelor of Education/PGCE or QTS 
* Paediatric first aid \(ideally with outdoor specialism - this can be arranged if not held\)

  
  
**What we can offer:**

The opportunity to enjoy working in a highly motivated team, with children who are eager to learn, in a school community where parents are very supportive, in the beautiful city of La Laguna, Tenerife.  
Lunch time meal is provided for all adults to be eaten with the children**.** We provide in-house training for continuous professional development.  
  
**How to apply**

Please apply by midnight on Thursday 20th May. We are committed to safeguarding and promoting the welfare of children and young people, and expect all staff and volunteers to share this commitment.  An enhanced DBS disclosure is required for this post.
