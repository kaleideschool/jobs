# Early Years Facilitator

#### **JOB DESCRIPTION**

* contributing to observations and the assessment of children’s learning and development
* attending staff meetings and training sessions

This is a full time position \(Monday - Friday\).

* Ability to empower children to solve problems themselves

* Willingness to work towards an unconditional approach \(no punishment or reward, including praise\)
* Ability to adapt to changing circumstances and to navigate interpersonal relationships
* A variety of interests and abilities that you will enjoy sharing with young people
